# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic migration of existing tests to the dual testing architecture, focusing on fixing the 40 failing test scenarios. The migration will ensure tests work correctly in both isolated and production modes while following the established dual testing guidelines and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Production Mode Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want production mode tests to initialize correctly, so that I can run tests against live production data with looneyTunesTest entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is tagged with @production THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize production mode context
2. WHEN production mode initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific failure reason
3. WHEN production test data is missing THEN the system SHALL validate and report which looneyTunesTest entities are required
4. IF production mode setup fails THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to run production-specific tests
5. WHEN production mode is active THEN the system SHALL use only looneyTunesTest entities for data operations

### Requirement 2: Context-Aware Data Management

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want API tests to use context-appropriate data identifiers, so that tests work correctly in both isolated and production modes without hardcoded values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test runs in isolated mode THEN the system SHALL use predefined test data identifiers (e.g., "ticket-001", "cust-001")
2. WHEN a test runs in production mode THEN the system SHALL use valid looneyTunesTest entity identifiers
3. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL generate context-appropriate identifiers based on the current test mode
4. WHEN retrieving test data THEN the system SHALL validate that the requested entities exist in the current context
5. IF test data is not found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggestions for data creation

### Requirement 3: Navigation System Reliability

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want navigation tests to work reliably across different viewports and modes, so that UI functionality is properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking navigation links THEN the system SHALL wait for page transitions to complete before proceeding
2. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative selectors and strategies
3. WHEN testing mobile navigation THEN the system SHALL properly detect and interact with mobile menu elements
4. WHEN validating responsiveness THEN the system SHALL use appropriate criteria for each viewport size
5. IF navigation elements are not found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information

### Requirement 4: Test Mode Detection and Fallback

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want robust test mode detection with proper fallback mechanisms, so that tests can recover from configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test mode cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL default to isolated mode
2. WHEN production mode fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback to isolated mode for dual-tagged tests
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
5. IF both modes fail THEN the system SHALL skip the test with appropriate reporting

### Requirement 5: Test Data Validation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want proper test data validation and cleanup, so that tests don't interfere with each other and production data remains clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests create data THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup after test completion
2. WHEN production tests run THEN the system SHALL validate that only looneyTunesTest entities are affected
3. WHEN test data is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent test execution and report validation errors
4. WHEN cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for manual cleanup
5. IF test data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using timestamp-based naming

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and diagnostic information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and detailed error context
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log request/response details for debugging
3. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL provide information about what was being waited for
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show expected vs actual values with context
5. IF configuration issues exist THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step resolution guidance

### Requirement 7: Performance and Timeout Management

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want appropriate timeout handling for different test operations, so that tests don't fail due to temporary performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN waiting for page loads THEN the system SHALL use appropriate timeouts based on operation type
2. WHEN database operations are slow THEN the system SHALL extend timeouts for data-heavy operations
3. WHEN network requests timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN UI elements are slow to appear THEN the system SHALL use progressive waiting strategies
5. IF operations consistently timeout THEN the system SHALL report performance issues with metrics

### Requirement 8: Cross-Mode Test Consistency

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want dual-tagged tests to behave consistently across both modes, so that I can validate functionality works the same way in both environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is tagged @dual THEN the system SHALL execute the same test logic in both modes
2. WHEN assertions differ between modes THEN the system SHALL use mode-appropriate validation criteria
3. WHEN data structures vary THEN the system SHALL normalize comparisons appropriately
4. WHEN timing differs between modes THEN the system SHALL adjust expectations accordingly
5. IF behavior differs significantly THEN the system SHALL report the differences for investigation
