# Test Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

The current test suite takes an excessive amount of time to start, impacting developer productivity and CI/CD pipeline efficiency. This feature aims to optimize test startup time and overall execution performance while maintaining test reliability and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to start quickly, so that I can get faster feedback during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `npm run test` THEN the test suite SHALL start within 30 seconds
2. WHEN browser launch timeout is configured THEN the system SHALL use a reasonable timeout value
3. WHEN tests are running THEN the browser SHALL launch without unnecessary delays

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to disable expensive features during development, so that I can run tests faster when debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video recording is disabled THEN test execution SHALL be faster
2. WHEN running tests locally THEN developers SHALL have the option to disable video recording
3. WHEN video recording is needed THEN it SHALL be easily re-enabled for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized parallel execution, so that tests complete faster on multi-core systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel threads are configured THEN the system SHALL utilize available CPU cores efficiently
2. WHEN running on different hardware THEN parallel thread count SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN there SHALL be no resource conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate test and reporting phases, so that I can run tests without waiting for report generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN developers SHALL have the option to skip report generation
2. WHEN reports are needed THEN they SHALL be generated separately
3. WHEN running in CI THEN full reporting SHALL be available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-compiled TypeScript, so that tests don't need to compile code at runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is pre-compiled THEN test startup SHALL be faster
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the build process SHALL be efficient
3. WHEN running tests THEN there SHALL be no runtime TypeScript compilation overhead
