# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the navigation test failures in the HWPC application's Cucumber test suite. The current navigation tests are failing because they attempt to interact with navigation elements before the JavaScript-based single-page application (SPA) has fully initialized and rendered the navigation components. The tests need to be enhanced to properly wait for dynamic content loading and use the correct selectors that match the actual application structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the navigation tests to wait for the SPA to fully initialize, so that the tests can reliably find and interact with navigation elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test navigates to the base URL THEN the system SHALL wait for the JavaScript application to fully initialize before proceeding
2. WHEN the navigation component is being loaded THEN the system SHALL wait for the navigation container to be populated with navigation elements
3. WHEN checking for navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use appropriate timeouts that account for JavaScript rendering time
4. WHEN the page is loading THEN the system SHALL wait for the `#navigation-container` element to contain the rendered navigation structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the navigation tests to use the correct selectors that match the actual application structure, so that the tests can successfully locate navigation elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for the main navigation THEN the system SHALL use the selector `.navigation[data-testid="main-nav"]` instead of generic fallback selectors
2. WHEN looking for navigation links THEN the system SHALL use selectors like `[data-testid="nav-tickets"]` that match the actual rendered structure
3. WHEN testing mobile navigation THEN the system SHALL use the correct mobile menu toggle selector `.mobile-menu-toggle[data-testid="mobile-menu-toggle"]`
4. WHEN verifying page navigation THEN the system SHALL use the specific data-testid attributes generated by the StaticNavigation component

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the navigation constants to be updated with the correct selectors from the actual application, so that all navigation tests use consistent and accurate element identification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NavigationConstants are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide selectors that match the StaticNavigation.js component structure
2. WHEN getting navigation selectors THEN the system SHALL prioritize data-testid attributes over generic CSS classes
3. WHEN handling different viewport categories THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate selectors for mobile menu vs desktop navigation
4. WHEN providing fallback selectors THEN the system SHALL include the actual selectors used by the application as primary options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the navigation page object to handle the asynchronous nature of the SPA, so that tests are stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the NavigationPage THEN the system SHALL wait for the navigation component to be fully mounted and rendered
2. WHEN navigating to a page THEN the system SHALL wait for both the navigation action and the subsequent page load to complete
3. WHEN verifying page elements THEN the system SHALL account for the time needed for JavaScript components to render
4. WHEN handling navigation errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear debugging information about the SPA state and loaded components
