# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ProductionTestDataManager class is missing critical context management methods that are required by the test hooks infrastructure. The hooks.ts file expects the ProductionTestDataManager to implement the same interface as DatabaseContextManager for managing test data contexts, but these methods are currently missing, causing TypeScript compilation errors and preventing tests from running.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want the ProductionTestDataManager to implement context management methods, so that production mode tests can properly set up and clean up test data contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test hooks call setupContext on ProductionTestDataManager THEN the system SHALL create and return a valid DataContext for production mode testing
2. WHEN setupContext is called with TestMode.PRODUCTION or TestMode.DUAL THEN the system SHALL initialize production test data and return a context with proper metadata
3. WHEN setupContext is called with invalid configuration THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive error message
4. IF the production test data setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error information for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want the ProductionTestDataManager to validate test data contexts, so that I can ensure the production test environment is properly configured before running tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validateContext is called with a valid production DataContext THEN the system SHALL return true
2. WHEN validateContext is called with an invalid or corrupted DataContext THEN the system SHALL return false
3. WHEN validateContext is called THEN the system SHALL verify the context mode matches production requirements
4. WHEN validateContext is called THEN the system SHALL verify that test data exists and is accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want the ProductionTestDataManager to clean up test data contexts, so that production test data is properly managed and doesn't accumulate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanupContext is called with a valid DataContext THEN the system SHALL properly clean up production test data
2. WHEN cleanupContext is called THEN the system SHALL respect the cleanup policy configuration
3. WHEN cleanupContext fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information but not throw exceptions that mask test failures
4. WHEN cleanupContext is called THEN the system SHALL ensure no test data is left in an inconsistent state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want the ProductionTestDataManager context methods to be compatible with the existing dual-mode testing infrastructure, so that the same hooks can work with both isolated and production test modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the context methods are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the same interface pattern as DatabaseContextManager
2. WHEN used in dual mode THEN the ProductionTestDataManager SHALL work seamlessly with the existing test infrastructure
3. WHEN context methods are called THEN they SHALL return DataContext objects that are compatible with the existing type definitions
4. WHEN integrated with hooks THEN the system SHALL support the same error handling and logging patterns as isolated mode
