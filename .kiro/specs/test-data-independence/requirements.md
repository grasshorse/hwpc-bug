# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The test suite currently has dependencies on pre-existing data in the test database, causing test failures when the database is reset. This creates brittle tests that cannot run reliably in isolation or in clean environments. The system needs to be refactored to ensure all tests can create their own test data and clean up after themselves, making the test suite independent of database state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want tests to be independent of pre-existing database state, so that tests can run reliably in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite runs THEN it SHALL NOT depend on any pre-existing data in the database
2. WHEN a database is reset THEN all tests SHALL still pass without modification
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with each other's data
4. WHEN a test creates data THEN it SHALL clean up that data after completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data to be created programmatically within each test, so that tests are self-contained and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test needs specific data THEN it SHALL create that data as part of the test setup
2. WHEN test data is created THEN it SHALL use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts
3. WHEN a test completes THEN it SHALL remove any data it created
4. IF test cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with other tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want a centralized test data factory system, so that test data creation is consistent and reusable across all tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL use factory methods for consistency
2. WHEN multiple tests need similar data THEN they SHALL use shared factory functions
3. WHEN test data is created THEN it SHALL follow realistic data patterns and constraints
4. WHEN factory methods are used THEN they SHALL support parameterization for different test scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test maintainer, I want clear identification of test data dependencies, so that I can easily understand and modify test requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing a test THEN it SHALL be clear what data the test requires
2. WHEN a test fails due to missing data THEN the error message SHALL clearly indicate the missing dependency
3. WHEN test data requirements change THEN the impact SHALL be easily identifiable
4. WHEN debugging tests THEN test data creation and cleanup SHALL be traceable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline operator, I want tests to run successfully in fresh environments, so that deployment pipelines are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in a CI environment THEN they SHALL pass without manual database setup
2. WHEN running tests against a clean database THEN all tests SHALL create necessary baseline data
3. WHEN tests complete in CI THEN the database SHALL be left in a clean state for subsequent runs
4. IF database cleanup fails in CI THEN the pipeline SHALL report the failure but not block deployment
