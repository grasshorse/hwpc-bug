# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the assignment of customer tickets to scheduled routes based on location proximity and route optimization. The system will automatically suggest optimal route assignments while allowing manual overrides for special circumstances. This functionality is critical for efficient service delivery and resource optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dispatcher, I want to assign tickets to scheduled routes based on customer location, so that I can optimize service delivery and minimize travel time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dispatcher views unassigned tickets THEN the system SHALL display tickets grouped by geographic proximity
2. WHEN a dispatcher selects a ticket THEN the system SHALL show all available scheduled routes within a configurable radius
3. WHEN the system suggests route assignments THEN it SHALL prioritize routes with the shortest travel distance
4. WHEN a ticket is assigned to a route THEN the system SHALL update the route schedule and ticket status
5. IF a route is at capacity THEN the system SHALL warn the dispatcher before allowing assignment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dispatcher, I want to see visual indicators of route capacity and location coverage, so that I can make informed assignment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the route assignment interface THEN the system SHALL display route capacity as a percentage
2. WHEN a route approaches capacity THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a warning color
3. WHEN displaying routes on a map THEN the system SHALL show service area boundaries
4. WHEN hovering over a route THEN the system SHALL display current assignments and available slots
5. IF multiple routes serve the same area THEN the system SHALL indicate overlapping coverage zones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dispatcher, I want to bulk assign multiple tickets to routes, so that I can efficiently process high volumes of service requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting multiple tickets THEN the system SHALL enable bulk assignment mode
2. WHEN in bulk assignment mode THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal route distribution
3. WHEN confirming bulk assignments THEN the system SHALL validate all assignments before processing
4. IF any assignment conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and require resolution
5. WHEN bulk assignment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes made

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want to override automatic route assignments, so that I can handle special customer requirements or emergency situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dispatcher attempts to assign a ticket to a non-optimal route THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN overriding an assignment THEN the system SHALL require a reason code
3. WHEN an override is saved THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and user information
4. IF an override creates scheduling conflicts THEN the system SHALL warn about potential issues
5. WHEN viewing assignment history THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate manual overrides

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a field technician, I want to see my assigned tickets organized by route sequence, so that I can plan my daily workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technician views their route THEN tickets SHALL be ordered by optimal travel sequence
2. WHEN the route sequence changes THEN the system SHALL automatically reorder ticket display
3. WHEN a ticket is completed THEN it SHALL be marked as such without affecting remaining sequence
4. IF route modifications occur THEN the technician SHALL receive real-time notifications
5. WHEN viewing ticket details THEN the system SHALL show estimated arrival times based on sequence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure location matching parameters, so that the system can adapt to different service areas and business rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring location settings THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of search radius parameters
2. WHEN setting route capacity limits THEN the system SHALL validate against existing assignments
3. WHEN updating assignment rules THEN changes SHALL apply to future assignments only
4. IF configuration changes affect existing routes THEN the system SHALL provide migration options
5. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all parameters before applying changes
