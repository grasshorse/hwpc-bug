# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current test suite is failing when validating the customers page because it expects a search interface to be present, but the actual website doesn't have search functionality on the customers page. The test validation logic needs to be updated to accurately reflect the actual website structure and remove the requirement for search interface validation on pages that don't have search functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the test validation to accurately reflect the actual website structure, so that tests pass when the navigation is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test navigates to the customers page THEN the validation SHALL NOT require a search interface to be present
2. WHEN the test validates the customers page THEN it SHALL only check for elements that actually exist on the page
3. WHEN the test runs the customers page validation THEN it SHALL pass if the page loads correctly and navigation works

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the page validation logic to be configurable, so that I can easily adjust validation requirements for different pages without breaking existing tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page configuration is defined THEN the search interface validation SHALL be optional
2. WHEN a page doesn't have search functionality THEN the validation SHALL skip search interface checks
3. WHEN updating page configurations THEN existing tests SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want clear error messages when validation fails, so that I can quickly identify what needs to be fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page validation fails THEN the error message SHALL clearly indicate which specific validation failed
2. WHEN search interface validation is skipped THEN the test SHALL log that search validation was skipped for that page
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the test SHALL log which validations were performed and their results
