# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dual testing architecture that supports both isolated database testing and live production testing. The system will enable the testing team to validate functionality through two distinct approaches: controlled database loading with data verification, and special test customers/routes in production that are easily identifiable but don't interfere with real users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a testing team member, I want to run isolated tests with controlled database states, so that I can verify data rendering and functionality without affecting production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is marked as "isolated", THEN the system SHALL load a predefined database state before test execution
2. WHEN isolated tests run, THEN the system SHALL verify that backend data is properly rendered in the frontend
3. WHEN isolated tests complete, THEN the system SHALL clean up or restore the original database state
4. IF database loading fails, THEN the system SHALL skip the test and report the failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a testing team member, I want to run live production tests using identifiable test data, so that I can verify functionality in the real production environment without impacting actual customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is marked as "production", THEN the system SHALL use predefined test customers and routes (looneyTunesTest pattern)
2. WHEN production tests run, THEN the system SHALL only interact with test data that follows the looneyTunesTest naming convention
3. WHEN production tests execute, THEN the system SHALL be easily identifiable by human operators monitoring the system
4. IF test data is not available in production, THEN the system SHALL create the necessary test entities before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to automatically determine their execution mode, so that I can write tests once and run them in either isolated or production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is executed, THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate testing mode based on configuration or environment variables
2. WHEN test mode is determined, THEN the system SHALL automatically set up the correct data context (isolated database or production test data)
3. WHEN tests run in different modes, THEN the system SHALL use the same test logic but different data sources
4. IF the environment cannot be determined, THEN the system SHALL default to isolated testing mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a testing team member, I want clear separation between test types, so that I can easily identify and run specific testing scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing test files, THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which tests support isolated mode, production mode, or both
2. WHEN running tests, THEN the system SHALL provide clear reporting on which mode was used for each test
3. WHEN tests fail, THEN the system SHALL include the testing mode in error reports
4. WHEN organizing tests, THEN the system SHALL support filtering and grouping by testing mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want production test data to be easily manageable, so that I can maintain test integrity without affecting real customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing test data, THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to create, update, and delete looneyTunesTest entities
2. WHEN test data exists in production, THEN the system SHALL ensure it follows consistent naming patterns for easy identification
3. WHEN production tests run, THEN the system SHALL validate that test data exists and is in the expected state
4. IF test data becomes corrupted or missing, THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to restore or recreate it

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor existing tests to use the new dual architecture, so that all tests can benefit from both testing approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring existing tests, THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current test functionality
2. WHEN converting tests, THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing test assertions and validations
3. WHEN tests are refactored, THEN the system SHALL support both the old and new testing approaches during transition
4. IF refactoring introduces issues, THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms to restore original test behavior
