Feature: Page Navigation Testing
    As a QA engineer, I want to test page navigation functionality
    So that I can ensure users can access all main application areas reliably

  Background:
    Given user is on baseurl

  @navigation @responsive @regression @sanity @isolated
  Scenario Outline: Navigate to main pages with responsive validation (Isolated Mode)
    When the user clicks "<page>"
    Then user should be on "<page>"
    And the navigation interface should be responsive

    Examples:
      | page      |
      | tickets   |
      | customers |
      # | routes    |
      # | reports   |
      # | dashboard |

  # @navigation @responsive @regression @sanity @production
  # Scenario Outline: Navigate to main pages with responsive validation (Production Mode)
  #   When the user clicks "<page>"
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the navigation interface should be responsive

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @responsive @dual
  # Scenario Outline: Navigate to main pages with dual-mode validation
  #   When the user clicks "<page>"
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the navigation interface should be responsive
  #   And the page data should be consistent with test mode

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @mobile @responsive @isolated
  # Scenario Outline: Mobile navigation via mobile menu (Isolated Mode)
  #   Given user is on baseurl with "mobile" viewport
  #   When the user navigates to "<page>" via mobile menu
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the navigation interface should be responsive
  #   And all touch targets should meet minimum size requirements

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @mobile @responsive @production
  # Scenario Outline: Mobile navigation via mobile menu (Production Mode)
  #   Given user is on baseurl with "mobile" viewport
  #   When the user navigates to "<page>" via mobile menu
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the navigation interface should be responsive
  #   And all touch targets should meet minimum size requirements

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @responsive @cross-viewport @dual
  # Scenario: Cross-viewport navigation responsiveness
  #   Given user is on baseurl
  #   When the user clicks "tickets"
  #   Then user should be on "tickets"
  #   And the navigation should adapt to viewport changes

  # @navigation @performance @isolated
  # Scenario Outline: Navigation performance validation (Isolated Mode)
  #   Given user is on baseurl
  #   When the user clicks "<page>"
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the page should load within 8 seconds

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @performance @production
  # Scenario Outline: Navigation performance validation (Production Mode)
  #   Given user is on baseurl
  #   When the user clicks "<page>"
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the page should load within 8 seconds

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @error-handling @dual
  # Scenario Outline: Navigation error recovery
  #   Given user is on baseurl
  #   When the user navigates to "<page>" with smart recovery
  #   Then user should be on "<page>"
  #   And the page should not be in an error state

  #   Examples:
  #     | page      |
  #     | tickets   |
  #     | customers |
  #     | routes    |
  #     | reports   |
  #     | dashboard |

  # @navigation @accessibility @dual
  # Scenario: Navigation accessibility validation
  #   Given user is on baseurl
  #   Then all navigation links should be accessible
  #   And the navigation should be responsive for current viewport
