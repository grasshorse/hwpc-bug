# Timeout Performance Baseline Report
Generated: 2025-10-08T17:27:32.907Z
Environment: local
Total Duration: 132.8s

## Summary
- Total Measurements: 56
- Total Wasted Time: 600.0s
- Average Timeout Utilization: 24.3%
- Potential Time Savings: 600.0s

## Recommendations
1. Low timeout utilization (24.3%) indicates timeouts are too conservative. Consider implementing smart timeout strategies with progressive timeouts.
2. High average wasted time per operation (10714ms). Implement application-specific readiness detection to reduce unnecessary waiting.
3. Significant time savings potential: 10.0 minutes could be saved across all measured operations. Prioritize timeout optimization implementation.
4. Local environment detected. Implement fast timeout profiles for local development to improve developer experience and test feedback speed.
