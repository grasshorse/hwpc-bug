## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the dual testing architecture and its benefits
2. Write tests that work in both isolated and production modes
3. Manage test data effectively for both environments
4. Troubleshoot common issues and implement best practices

## Training Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Dual Testing Architecture (30 minutes)

#### Concepts Covered
- What is dual testing architecture?
- Benefits and use cases
- When to use isolated vs production testing
- Architecture overview and components

#### Key Takeaways
- **Isolated Testing**: Controlled environment with predefined data states
- **Production Testing**: Real environment with identifiable test data
- **Dual Mode**: Tests that work in both environments
- **Automatic Detection**: System determines mode based on configuration

#### Discussion Questions
1. What challenges do you face with current testing approaches?
2. How might dual testing help with your specific testing scenarios?
3. What concerns do you have about testing in production?

### Module 2: Test Mode Detection and Configuration (45 minutes)

#### Concepts Covered
- Environment variables and configuration
- Test tags (@isolated, @production, @dual)
- Mode detection logic and fallbacks
- Configuration best practices

#### Hands-On Exercise 1: Setting Up Test Modes

**Objective**: Configure and run tests in different modes

**Steps**:
1. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export TEST_MODE=isolated
   npm run test -- features/navigation.feature
   
   export TEST_MODE=production
   npm run test -- features/navigation.feature
   ```

2. Create a simple test with mode tags:
   ```gherkin
   @dual
   Scenario: Basic navigation test
     Given I am on the dashboard
     When I click on "Customers"
     Then I should see the customers page
   ```

3. Run the test and observe mode detection logs

**Expected Outcome**: Understanding of how mode detection works and ability to control test execution mode.

### Module 3: Test Data Management (60 minutes)

#### Concepts Covered
- Isolated test data structure and organization
- Production test data naming conventions
- Data lifecycle management
- Creating and maintaining test data

#### Hands-On Exercise 2: Managing Test Data

**Objective**: Create and manage test data for both modes

**Part A: Isolated Test Data**
1. Create a test data scenario:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .kiro/test-data/isolated/customer-scenarios/
   ```

2. Create SQL file with test data:
   ```sql
   -- .kiro/test-data/isolated/customer-scenarios/basic-customers.sql
   INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone) VALUES
   ('Test Customer 1', 'test1@example.com', '555-0001'),
   ('Test Customer 2', 'test2@example.com', '555-0002');
   ```

**Part B: Production Test Data**
1. Create production test customers:
   ```bash
   npm run test:create-production-data
   ```

2. Verify test data exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '%looneyTunesTest%';
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to create and manage test data for both testing modes.

### Module 4: Writing Dual-Mode Tests (90 minutes)

#### Concepts Covered
- Designing mode-agnostic tests
- Flexible assertions and data handling
- Context-aware step definitions
- Error handling and recovery

#### Hands-On Exercise 3: Converting Existing Tests

**Objective**: Convert an existing test to support dual modes

**Original Test**:
```gherkin
Scenario: View customer details
  Given I am on the customers page
  When I click on "John Doe"
  Then I should see customer details for "John Doe"
```

**Step 1**: Analyze the test and identify data dependencies
**Step 2**: Create dual-mode version:
```gherkin
@dual
Scenario: View customer details
  Given I am on the customers page
  When I click on the first customer in the list
  Then I should see customer details
  And the customer information should be complete
```

**Step 3**: Update step definitions to be context-aware:
```typescript
When('I click on the first customer in the list', async function() {
  const firstCustomer = await this.page.locator('[data-testid="customer-row"]').first();
  await firstCustomer.click();
});

Then('the customer information should be complete', async function() {
  const name = await this.page.textContent('[data-testid="customer-name"]');
  const email = await this.page.textContent('[data-testid="customer-email"]');
  
  expect(name).toBeTruthy();
  expect(email).toBeTruthy();
  
  if (this.testMode === TestMode.PRODUCTION) {
    expect(name).toContain('looneyTunesTest');
  }
});
```

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to write and convert tests for dual-mode execution.

### Module 5: Advanced Features and Troubleshooting (60 minutes)

#### Concepts Covered
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Debugging and monitoring
- Common issues and solutions

#### Hands-On Exercise 4: Troubleshooting Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Test Fails in Production Mode**
```
Error: Customer "Test Customer" not found
```

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check if production test data exists
2. Verify naming conventions
3. Update test to use appropriate data

**Scenario 2: Database Loading Timeout**
```
Error: Database restore timeout after 30000ms
```

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check database connection
2. Verify backup file integrity
3. Increase timeout values

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to diagnose and resolve common issues.
